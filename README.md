Legacy Code Audit & Identified Issues

Before applying AI-assisted refactoring, the initial codebase was thoroughly analyzed. The following critical architectural flaws, anti-patterns, and technical debt items were identified:

1. Architecture & Design Flaws
   "God Controller" Anti-Pattern: Controllers contained direct business logic, database queries, and validation rules instead of delegating tasks to Service layers.
   Tight Coupling: Components were tightly bound together, violating the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and making unit testing nearly impossible.
   Hardcoded Configurations: Sensitive data, application properties, and magic numbers were hardcoded inside classes instead of utilizing application.yml and environment variables.
2. Database & Performance Issues
   N+1 Query Problem: Lazy loading inside loops caused severe database performance bottlenecks when fetching related entities (e.g., User -> Orders -> Items).
   Missing Pagination & Filtering: Large data collections were loaded entirely into memory, risking OutOfMemoryError under high loads.
   Lack of Database Constraints: Missing proper indexes and unique constraints on frequently searched columns in PostgreSQL.
3. Error Handling & Security
   Generic Exception Handling: The app lacked a @ControllerAdvice global exception handler, returning raw, unformatted 500 server errors to the client instead of meaningful HTTP status codes and custom error messages.
   Security Gaps: Unsecured endpoints, missing input validation (@Valid), and lack of proper request sanitization, leaving the app vulnerable to basic injection attacks.
4. Testing & Quality Assurance
   Zero Test Coverage: Complete absence of unit, integration, or API tests.
   Poor Code Readability: Inconsistent naming conventions, duplicated blocks of code (DRY violation), and dead code left from previous iterations.
   Missing CI/CD: No automated pipelines to build, test, or verify code quality on pull requests.
